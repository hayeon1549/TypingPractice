Java began in 1991 with the language "Oak," invented by James Gosling with other researchers at Sun Microsystems.
Oak was initially intended to be used in consumer electronics, but was used as a programming language on the Internet 
with the advent of the Internet and renamed Java.
In 1995, Java 1.0 was announced and promised "Write Once, Run Anywhere".
From 1995 to 1999, Java was inferior to C++ as development of Windows programs was the mainstream. 
There was also a problem with overusing memory and CPU.
However, since 1999, Java has been activated for Web application deployment with the Internet activated.
Because Java was the only language that could be practiced everywhere in a single writing process.
Java is a highly portable language.
Transplantability refers to the ability to move programs between systems with different execution environments.
For example, if a program running on a Windows operating system can run on Linux or UNIX, it is highly portable.
Java can be run on any operating system with Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
that correspond to parts first, assemble and connect them one by one, and complete the entire program.
The language used in object-oriented programming is called object-oriented language.
Java creates a design-in-class to create objects, and links objects to create programs that meet their purpose.
Java automatically manages memory.
C++ should be coded by the developer himself to remove objects created in memory. 
If this is not done faithfully, the program will become incomplete and experience a sudden crash.
Java is designed to prevent developers from accessing memory directly. Memory is directly managed by Java.
Java developers can reduce the effort of memory management and focus on writing core function codes.
