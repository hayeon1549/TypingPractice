Python is an interpreter language created in 1990 by Guido Van Rossum of Amsterdam. 
Guido is said to have taken the name Python from his favorite comedy show, "Monty Python's Flying Circus." 
Python's dictionary meaning is a large snake living in a cave in Mount Parnassus in ancient myths
, and it is said that Apollo had defeated Python in Delphi. 
This is why most Python book covers and icons are drawn in the shape of snakes.
Currently, Python is not very well known in Korea, but it is widely used not only for the purpose of 
learning but also for practical purposes in foreign countries, a prime example of which is Google. 
More than 50 percent of Google's software is made of Python, it said. 
Some of the more famous things are Dropbox, Django, and so on.
Also, because the Python program is so easy and easy to collaborate and maintain, many programs and modules 
already written in other languages are being re-configured into Python. In Korea, the user base is expanding 
further in recognition of its value, and companies are developing programs using Python.
Don't you want to break away from language surrounded by difficult grammar and numerous rules? 
Python's grammar itself is very easy and concise, and it is very similar to the way one thinks.
With Python, a programmer can do most of the work.
However, it is no exaggeration to say that few of these things cannot be done with Python.
Python may also include modules in its Python program in other languages to overcome the above weaknesses. 
There is a saying that Python and C are perfect matches. 
In other words, the overall framework of the program is to make it Python, 
and the part that requires a fast speed is to make it C and include it in the Python program.
